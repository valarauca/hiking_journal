Rancheria Trailhead (36.975345,-118.9604276) <-> Tehipite Valley Overlook (36.912811,-118.8168624)

* **Rough Trail Conditions**: Tehipite Valley trail (29E45) is in very bad shape.
* **Slow Pace**: Break/eating schedule was not followed. Aim to stop 20min of every 2 hours moving.
* **Late Start**: Sun rises at 7am, wasn't to trailhead until 9:15am
* **Blister**: Right little toe

Lesson Learned:

* **New Shoes**: Replace La Sportiva with barefoot shoes, more room in toebox.
* **Stick to The Plan**: Arrive at trail head on time
* **Eat & Drink More**: Stop every 2 hours, even if you don't have great seating options.
