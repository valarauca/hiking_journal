Rancheria Trailhead (36.975345,-118.9604276) <-> Tehipite Valley Overlook (36.912811,-118.8168624)

* **Rough Trail Conditions**: Tehipite Valley trail (29E45) is in very bad shape.
* **Slow Pace**: Break/eating schedule was not followed. Aim to stop 20min of every 2 hours moving.
* **Late Start**: Sun rises at 7am, wasn't to trailhead until 9:15am
* **Blister**: Right little toe

Lesson Learned:

* **New Shoes**: Replace La Sportiva with barefoot shoes, more room in toebox.
* **Stick to The Plan**: Arrive at trail head on time
* **Eat & Drink More**: Stop every 2 hours, even if you don't have great seating options.

Rancheria Trailhead (36.975345,-118.9604276) <-> Tehipite Dome (36.91880,-118.78100)

* **Rough Trail Conditions**: Final 1.5 miles of bush waking is rough going. Swampy & steep.
* **Blister**: 3 on each foot. Need to retire La Sportivia Karacal (size 13.5) toebox too tight.
* **Late Start**: Wasn't to trailhead until 9:20am

Improvements:

* **Planning** (out): Don't take electrolytes every 2 hours, feels like over kill. Consider low dosage caffine pills instead.
* **Planning** (return): Taking water & a pain killer every 1hr was pretty great. Pace stayed pretty solid.
* **Solo**: We made it & didn't die hurray.

Mistakes:

* **Didnt replace shoes**: Ordered 13.5wide Altras Lone Peak 6's. Maybe they'll work better.
* **Late Start**: Didn't break camp until Noon and had to night hike back.

Rancheria Trailhead (36.975345,-118.9604276) <-> Tehipite Dome (36.91880,-118.78100)

* **Blister**: None. Xero aqua shoes performed exceptionally well. Bad grip on wet surfaces.
* **Planning**: Great

Improvements:

* **Lighter Kit**: worked great.

Mistakes:

* **Pain Killers**: Took too many, got a stomach ulcer.

Southern Lost Coast. Usal Beach to Usal Beach

* **Rough Trail Conditions**: A lot of blow down. Last 3 miles from Jackass to Usal was hard route finding.
* **Blister**: None. Xero Aquashoes stay winning. Bad grip on wet surfaces.

Improvements:

* **Planning**: Well Planned

Mistakes:

* **Pack Weight**: Approximately 35lbs total (20lbs base weight) made the hilly sections a slog.
* **Bear Can**: Invest in a bear bag.
* **Calories**: Be mindful of consumption. Day 2 I ate in an insufficient breakfast and felt like death. Killed pace.

## 2023-March-18

Up & Down Mt. Umunhum from Mockingbird Hill Entrance (24.5mi round trip)

* 100cals of sugar & 500ml of water helped keep pace up.
* Average pace was still ~21min/mile.
* No blisters. Xero Aquashoes have some drawbacks when walking on rocks, after ~20 miles my feet get a little raw.
